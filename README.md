# Ski DIN Calculator Android Application
## [Google Play Store Download Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ski.dincalc)

This app can calculate your recommended ski binding release tension (DIN) based on age, height, weight, skier type*, and boot sole length**. It can accommodate measurements provided in either metric or standard units.

The DIN setting determines the safest release tension setting for your bindings, given your skier details. This assumes that your bindings are still indemnified by the manufacturer and are properly adjusted and tested by a certified technician to the manufacturer's specifications.

* **type 2**:  
    * between type 1 and 2, prefers moderate terrain and speeds.
    
* **type 3**:

## **Boot Sole Length
Boot sole length can be found stamped on the heel lug of most boots. It typically ranges from 195mm to 365mm (mondo size 14.5 to 32.5). If it is not listed, boot sole length can be measured by taking the distance from the front edge of the toe lug to the back edge of the heel lug carefully and accurately.
