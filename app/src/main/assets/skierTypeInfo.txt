The following descriptions should enable skiers to classify themselves and their skier type in accordance with ISO 11088. Keep in mind that the type of skier classification has nothing in common with the skierâ€™s ability. For example, many advanced skiers who have a smooth skiing style may be correctly classified as a Type II skier.
